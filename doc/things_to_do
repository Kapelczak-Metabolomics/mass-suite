1. Either finish own peak picking workflow or using the peakonly workflow(after totally understand it)
	**seperate task

	User case: input-raw mzml, output-csv/xlsx with m/z(centralized) rt(centralized) rtrange? peakarea
	May require super computer/aws for the intensive computing


2. Alignment based on either a) output spreadsheet(using points) or b) using chromatogram
	*main task

	for a) local work with selected algorithms
	b) may need computing assisstance and more complicated
	--Need discussion

3. Clustering from the alignment

	Unsupervised ML preferred

4. Prediction based on Clustering?

5.optimize the visualization part--give a handy GUI for users
